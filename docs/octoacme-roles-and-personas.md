## How to Assign Roles

When starting a new project or sprint, clearly define and assign roles to ensure accountability and avoid confusion:

- **Single Owner per Role**: Each role should have one primary owner per project or sprint. This creates clear accountability and a single point of contact.
- **Document Role Assignments**: Record role assignments in the project's main issue, sprint card, or project README so everyone knows who to contact.
- **Review Regularly**: During retrospectives or planning sessions, review whether role assignments are working effectively and adjust as needed.
- **Combine When Appropriate**: For smaller projects, one person may wear multiple hats (e.g., Developer + Security Champion), but make these dual roles explicit.
- **Delegate, Don't Duplicate**: Avoid having multiple people share the same role responsibility without clear delineation of duties.
