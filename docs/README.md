# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

OctoAcme follows a lightweight Agile process centered on short planning cycles and continuous delivery. Work is organized into a prioritized backlog maintained in GitHub issues, with regular backlog grooming sessions and sprint planning meetings to select and commit to work items. Each work item includes clear acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done to ensure alignment between product, engineering, and QA before code is merged.

Roles and responsibilities are defined to streamline delivery and accountability. Product Managers own prioritization and stakeholder communication, Engineering Leads coordinate technical direction and architecture, and Developers implement features and fixes. Dedicated QA engineers work with the team to define test plans and verify releases, while DevOps/Release engineers manage CI/CD pipelines and release coordination. Designers, security reviewers, and subject-matter stakeholders participate as needed during planning and review phases.

Communication is a mix of synchronous and asynchronous practices designed to keep teams aligned and reduce context switching. Daily stand-ups and weekly planning meetings create short feedback loops, while GitHub issues and pull requests are used for detailed asynchronous discussions and decision records. Centralized documentation in the docs/ folder, regular demos for stakeholders, and concise status updates—shared via the team's communication channels—help maintain transparency and provide an audit trail for decisions.

Quality assurance and release practices emphasize automation, review, and incremental rollout. All changes are reviewed via pull requests with at least one peer reviewer and must pass the CI test suite before merging. Automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are executed in CI, and feature flags or staged rollouts are used for higher-risk changes. Post-release monitoring, bug triage, and regular retrospectives drive continuous improvement in both process and product quality.
