# Communication &amp; Meeting Guidelines

Purpose: Keep communication effective and minimize unnecessary context switching.

Synchronous Cadence
- Daily stand-ups: 15 minutes, focus on blockers and priorities
- Sprint planning: timeboxed, define sprint commitments and acceptance criteria
- Weekly cross-functional sync: optional for larger initiatives
- Demos / show-and-tell: at the end of each sprint or milestone

Asynchronous practices
- Use GitHub issues and PRs for decision records and detailed discussions
- Centralize persistent docs in docs/ and link from issues/PRs
- Use short status updates in the team channel (e.g., Slack) for progress

Decision ownership
- Capture decisions in PRs or a decisions.md file with linked issues and owners

Meeting best practices
- Share an agenda before the meeting
- Timebox discussions and capture action items with owners
